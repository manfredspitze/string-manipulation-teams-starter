## Python: String Manipulation


### Getting Started

- Work with your assigned team
- Review on w3schools.com **as a team** 3 - 4 string methods 
- Run the **Try It Yourself** example code for each string method your team investigates
- Make sure your team understands how each string method works

### Helpful Resources

- See the list of [Python string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_methods.asp) on the w3schools.com website

### What Your Team Needs to Do Today

On your team's slip of paper:

- write your team members' names at the top of the slip of paper
- then think of a short, classroom-friendly string and write it down on the paper
- then write a set of instructions for the other team you'll exchange slips of paper with
- choose two (2) string methods from the list below
- tell the other team how they should use the two string methods with the string your group came up with 

**Example Instructions:**

- String: May the Force be with you!
- Instructions: Replace 'you' with 'your BFF' and convert the entire string to title case.

**Include any two (2) of the following string methods in your instructions for the other team:**
- find ()
- isdigit ( )
- isalpha ( )
- capitalize ( ) # Capitalize the first letter of the string
- upper ( )
- count ( ) # Tell Python to count the number of characters in the string
- replace ( ) 
- startswith ( )
- endswith ( )
- format ( )
