## Python: String Manipulation


### Getting Started

- Work with your assigned team
- Review on w3schools.com **as a team** 3 - 4 string methods 
- Run the **Try It Yourself** example code for each string method your team investigates
    - Example: [**Try It Yourself**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_isupper.asp) for the `isupper ( )` string method
- Make sure your team understands how each string method works

### Helpful Resources

- See the list of [Python string methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_methods.asp) on the w3schools.com website

### What Your Team Needs to Do Today

On your team's slip of paper:

- write your team members' names at the top of the slip of paper
- then think of a short, classroom-friendly string and write it down on the paper
- then write a set of instructions for the other team you'll exchange slips of paper with
- choose two (2) string methods from the list below
- tell the other team how they should use the two string methods with the string your group came up with 

**Example Instructions:**

- String: May the Force be with you!
- Instructions: Replace 'you' with 'your BFF' and convert the entire string to title case.

**Include any two (2) of the following string methods in your instructions for the other team:**
- find ()
- isdigit ( )
- isalpha ( )
- capitalize ( ) # Capitalize the first letter of the string
- upper ( )
- count ( ) # Tell Python to count the number of characters in the string
- replace ( ) 
- startswith ( )
- endswith ( )
- format ( )

### Writing Your Code

1. Create for your team an empty project folder on your workstation's Desktop named: **string-methods-practice**

2. Add an empty Python file called `string_methods.py` to your project folder.

3. Add a comment block to the top of your script that lists the names of the people in your team and the current date.

4. Drag and drop the string-methods-practice folder onto the Visual Studio Code shortcut to open your team's project folder.

5. Follow the instructions the other group gave your group; use VS Code to add your code to your string_methods.py file.

6. Run and debug your script in VS Code.

7. Attach and submit your group's finished script to the **1.7 Strings Methods (Part 1)** assignment on Google Classroom.
